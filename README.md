## How to Get Started
1. Download this repository from the `engineering` branch.
2. Run a PHP server on localhost to serve the content: `php -S localhost:8000`
3. Visit `localhost:8000` to see the web page.
4. Because this is a single pager, it _should_ also work to just load the `index.html` file in your browser of choice.
